# githubScrapper
This Program is used to scrap the github topic and its descriptions along with the repositories associated with that topic and also the issue posted on that repositories into CSV file. his Script is written in python3 and the library used is Selenium. This Selenium library handles the all the automation stuff like opening of browser , put request to website fill search box and scraping stuff.

For using the selenium first download the geckodriver driver which is a driver for firefox browser and chromedriver for chrome browser. I used so Firefox browser so, i have included the geckodriver in this repository so, no need to download externally.

currently the issue is that the program works on recusions and due to high level of recursion some times the program get stop. if anyone pulls this repository, please fix this issue.ðŸ˜Š
